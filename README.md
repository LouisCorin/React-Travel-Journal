This Travel Journal was made entirely using React on Scrimba.com

Things I've learned while building this website:

While building this project, I learned about Props in react. Props are the most fundamental topic in react, making writing more composable code so easy, Like the cards in this project were reused to build up the whole section. Mapping data: props enable us to use data and map over it to create the website we see here.

The website was deployed using Netlify and made from scratch on the Scrimba website.

Here we got an image of the website along with the link.
